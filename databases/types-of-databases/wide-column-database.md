### What is a wide-column database? <a href="#what-is-a-wide-column-database" id="what-is-a-wide-column-database"></a>

Wide-column databases belong to the NoSQL family of databases and are primarily used to handle massive amounts of data, technically called Big Data.

Wide-column databases are perfect for analytical use cases. They have a high performance and a scalable architecture.

Also known as column-oriented databases, wide-column databases store data in a record with a dynamic number of columns. A record can hold billions of columns.

### Popular wide-column databases <a href="#popular-wide-column-databases" id="popular-wide-column-databases"></a>

Some of the popular wide-column databases are Cassandra, HBase, Google BigTable, ScyllaDB, etc.

If you have a use case where you need to grapple with Big Data, a wide-column database would fit best.

Wide-column databases are built to manage Big Data, ensuring scalability, performance, and high availability.

### Real-life implementations <a href="#real-life-implementations" id="real-life-implementations"></a>

Some of the real-world implementations of the tech:

* [Netflix uses Cassandra](https://netflixtechblog.com/aegisthus-a-bulk-data-pipeline-out-of-cassandra-984882557fa) in the analytics infrastructure.
* [Adobe and other big guns use HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/poweredbyhbase.html) for processing large amounts of data.
